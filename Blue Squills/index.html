                How many million Aprils came<p>
                Before I ever knew<p>
                How white a cherry bough could be,<p>
                A bed of squills, how blue!<p>
                And many a dancing April<p>
                When life is done with me,<p>
                Will lift the blue flame of the flower<p>
                And the white flame of the tree.<p>
                Oh burn me with your beauty, then,<p>
                Oh hurt me, tree and flower,<p>
                Lest in the end death try to take<p>
                Even this glistening hour.<p>
                O shaken flowers, O shimmering trees,<p>
                O sunlit white and blue,<p>
                Wound me, that I, through endless sleep,<p>
                May bear the scar of you.<p>
